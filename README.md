# CVPractice

Project Description: A simple program that uses computer vision to detect whether the most prevalent colour in a camera frame is red, yellow, or blue, and moves a car along a road accordingly using Pygame, with red telling the car to stop, yellow telling the car to move slowly, and blue telling the car to move quickly (blue was used instead of green since it was easier to determine the line between blue and yellow than it was to determine the line between green and yellow). Note that this project is still under construction, and so it may not work very well. 

Instructions: 
Make sure to have the following for the best experience:
- A webcam/camera on your device (preferably a computer)
- Python 3.9.6
- Pygame

Download the CVPractice folder and open the Frame.py file. The program will open to an image of a road with a car on it. Place red, yellow, or blue objects in front of the camera to "move" the car accordingly. 

Note: For the best results, use colours that fall strictly within their categories (e.g. a shade of blue closer to the middle of its spectrum rather than turquoise).
